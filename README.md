# miniIntro
I was contributing to open-source projects on GitHub and I found out that the way the industry writes UIViews is different from what I used to do.  For making UIs before, I used storyboarding. I felt the need to switch to making UIs programmatically, so I created this mini-learning project.  Here, I have implemented some core objects from UIKit and set AutoLayout constraints.
